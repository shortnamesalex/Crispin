Hi. shortnamesalex here.

The website you are seeing here is home to my 2nd ever resource pack, Crispin. It was born on 4/18/2020, a day after my friends birthday, Rutherin. If you don't know who she is, I'll give you a summary.

She is a gifted shader developer, a texture artist, a modeler, a cutie, an expertise in her field that constantly proves me wrong cause I don't even have the bare minimum knowledge of OpenGL, or anything really, and an awesome, loveable person.

Crispin was made with a couple of ideas in mind, a resource pack made to look good with Raspberry, one thats bright and simplistic, takes advantage of as many of Optifine's features as possible (custom loading scenes, ctm's, emissive textures, animated textures, etc...) and also takes advantage of shader support (speculars, normals, etc...)    

# **Features:**

- Hand-drawn textures made by my hands.

- Uses as many special Optifine features as possible.

- raspPBR support.

- Custom music disc music. (all of them are not copyrighted btw)

# Shader recommended: 

- Rutherin's Raspberry Shaders: https://rutherin.netlify.app/ (only works on nvidia and amd cards)

(go and support rutherin on patreon, she deserves all the support she has.)

# Other shaders recommended:

(here are some alternatives if raspberry doesnt work on your gpu for whatever reason.)

# Thanks:

Paint.net was used to make this pack.

Normal maps were generated through Bounding Box Software's Materalize tool: https://www.gamefromscratch.com/post/2018/10/16/Materialize-Free-Texture-Map-Generation-Tool-Released.aspx

Panorama was made with Runorama: https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/runorama

Big thanks goes to Flat Jim on the Barazoku server for showing me how to do normals correctly on the Materalize tool and introduce me to the Runorama mod.

Custom music:

- C418 - Ki used on C418 - Mutation

- Downtown Binary - Midnight Tokyo used on music disc Mall.

- C418 - Beton used on music disc Blocks.

Big thanks and hugs to: qweebo, rutherin, Snurf, xirreal, dakine, Prismatic Spirit, Chloe and Hush in Barazoku for giving me the energy and confidence to keep working on this pack.

Honourable mentions go to C418, his music is godlike.
